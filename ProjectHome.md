A Magic Cube puzzle game on the Wii.

## What's a Magic Cube? ##
The Magic Cube  (also known as Rubik's Cube) is a mechanical puzzle game that was very popular in the 80ies. In it's basic version each of the six faces of the cube is covered by 9 stickers, among six solid colors. A pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently mixing up the colors. For the puzzle to be solved each face must be a solid color.

## Game Mechanics ##
Cubiic is a digital version of the classic mechanical puzzle game. The cube consists of three planes on each of the cube's axis (x-, y-, z-axis). Thus making a total of nine planes that can be rotated either clockwise or anticlockwise to solve the puzzle. You can rotate one of the planes at a time. The currently selected plane is highlighted (The colors on the selected plane are a little darker than the colors of the rest of the cube). The D-Pad is used to select the plane to be rotated. Pressing up/down changes the selected axis, pressing left/right toggles the selected plane on that axis. Finally the A- and B-button on the Wiimote are used to rotate the currently selected plane clockwise resp. anticlockwise.
